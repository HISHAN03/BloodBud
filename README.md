# HENHACKS 2025
## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from the number of blood tests we undergo each year. When we visit the doctorâ€™s office to review our results, we often receive only a brief summary rather than an in-depth explanation. In many cases, we are told not to worry about certain test results, even if they are slightly out of range, without a clear understanding of what they mean.

Blood tests are essential for understanding our overall health because they provide key insights into our body's function. They can help detect early signs of diseases, monitor ongoing medical conditions, and assess the effectiveness of treatments. By understanding our blood test results, we can take steps to improve our health, make informed lifestyle choices, and have more meaningful discussions with our healthcare providers.
## What it does
BloodQwurik helps you better understand your blood test results by providing personalized insights to your health information. If you're curious to learn more, you can explore deeper with our Dr. Health Assistant, which can answer any questions you have about your blood test results.

Additionally, BloodQwurik can track your previous blood reports and generate visualizations, allowing you to see trends and changes over time. With interactive graphs comparing your past and present results, you can gain a picture of your health progression and make more informed decisions about your well-being.
## How we built it

We built BloodQwurik using Next.js, MySQL, Google Gemini, and Python, integrating these technologies to create a powerful website.

Our team collaborated closely to ensure every component works together, from data processing and AI-powered insights to a user interface. Next.js powers the front end for a smooth and responsive experience, while MySQL stores user data. Google Gemini enhances the platform with advanced AI-driven analysis, and Python handles data processing and backend operations.

By combining these technologies, we created a system that not only delivers accurate and insightful blood test interpretations but also allows users to track their health over time with ease.

## Challenges we ran into
It was our team's first time working with MySQL and integrating it with Next.js to store and manage user information. Setting up the database, handling queries, and ensuring communication between the frontend and backend was a learning experience.

Additionally, for half of our team, this was their first time using Next.js, so we had to familiarize ourselves with its framework, server-side rendering, and API routes. Despite the challenges, we collaborated, learned from each other, and successfully built a system that handles user data while maintaining a smooth and responsive user experience. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we accomplished a working website that has the features that we wanted!

## What we learned
How to create a next.js and MySQL website!

## What's next for BloodBud
We are excited to see what's to come with this project, and how our team can continue to redefine clarity in the healthcare field beyond bloodwork. As we continue to expand our knowledge of artificial intelligence we can continue to build and create a more efficient experience for the user.
